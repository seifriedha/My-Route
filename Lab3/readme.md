This project was created for Lab 3 in my Web Mapping class. I named the project My Drive to Campus because it is a map that portrays my route to school every day. There is a dashed line that represents the drive, and markers at places of interest along my route. The base map that I used is the Esri World Topo Map, which I got from Leaflet. I also used the Leaflet library as well as the Jquery library. I used multiple sources to obtain the data for this map. I began with Google Maps to obtain the route, then I used the website mapstogpx. This allowed me to turn the google maps link into GPX. After this, I opened the gpx file from the website into geojson.io to download it as a GeoJson file. From here, I was able to insert the file into Atom to continue editing.
